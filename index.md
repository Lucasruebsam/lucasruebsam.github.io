## Why is it important for companies to enable a good and fast internal communication through digitalization?

Digitalization is a huge and unstoppable megatrend in the modern world since ages (Gillior, 2018). While most of the companies focus on digitizing processes to improve the efficiency, a comparable low amount focuses to digitize and improve the communication within a company (Hays, 2018,p.2). This report provides an overview about what internal communication means, where it takes place, the advantages that come from digitizing it, why it is important to foster it and how companies communicate nowadays with different digital tools.

### What does it mean when we talk about internal communication and where does it take place?

When we talk about internal or intercompany communication, its meant communication within one company and the belonging subsidiaries and other company locations.

Business units, teams and skilled employees are nowadays in the modern world of multinational enterprises spread around the globe. While the digitalization in companies increases, the number of projects and interlinkages between the different company locations increases as well (Bloomberg, 2018). In order to operate successfully and beneficial, the level of intercompany or internal communication is highly important.

Communication can be executed by human beings but also automatically by machines or software via multiple channels. There is a difference between offline and online channels. Offline channels are those which do not have a digital connection for example post, or face to face meetings. On the other side, online channels can be related to the internet or in which technology is implicated and is for instance, online meetings or email communication.

### Why is a good internal communication important?

Having a good internal communication is important for any company. “People, communication, organization and administration are interrelated factors that need to be examined in detail” (Thayer, 2012, p.29 as cited in Neto, da Silva, & Ferreira 2018, p.218). Communication is important to build up relationships, to make momentous decisions and clarify problems or to help others (Neto, da Silva, & Ferreira 2018, p.218). According to the HR-Report of Hays, not enough communication is the biggest obstacle for leaders, while nowadays the focus is still on the competencies of the topic related know-how instead of communication skills (2018, p.2).

Communication is a big factor to succeed. Using slow communication channels within the fast-changing environment will lead to unmotivated and frustrated employees. According to the journal of Neto, da Silva and Ferreira communication promotes not just decisions, but also organizational values and it guides employees in the processes of structural change (2018, p.217). Companies are forced to frequently adapt, to decide quickly in order to stay tuned to the changing environment.

### How does companies communicate internally nowadays?

The way companies communicate did not just changed in the recent years in terms of tools used to communicate, but also to whom employees communicate changed. This is based on the fact, that more and more companies aiming to work within an agile environment. That’s why more and more companies focus to enable these open cross-hierarchical communication possibilities (Hays 2018, p.26). Let’s go to some business scenarios, which can easily be improved by easy to use and access tools.
Writing e-Mails is still a communication method a huge amount of companies is using, because they are used to it and nobody initiate to change. A big amount of processes within and across finance, sales or even marketing is taking place at Outlook for example, which not just creates an unstructured overload of information. It also creates bottlenecks, people forget to respond as they oversee mails and in addition spam mails might disturb even more. According to an article on [Inc.](https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html) by John Brandon many companies starting to use instant messaging tools like [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/de-de/?eu_nc=1) (2015). These tools not just enable quick, instant communication possibilities, but also comes with the possibility to create so called channels. The employees can create these on their own for a specific project or their department for example. In them you can share files, links, and information to everyone instantly and 100% transparent.

Another obsolete internal communication method is face-to-face meetings and to be more concrete, meetings with employees that are not working within the same company location. Even today, in which the awareness for the ongoing climate change is extremely immense, people fly sometimes daily around the globe in order to physically participate in meetings with their colleagues. That is not just super bad for our all environment, the planet, but it is also expensive and time consuming. These should try to enable remote meetings. The most common tool for remote meetings is either [Cisco Webex](https://www.webex.com/de/pricing/free-trial-DG.html?DG=01-04-07-DE-12-01-05-06&TrackID=1077663&country=DE&psearchID=%2Bwebex-meeting&_bk=%2Bwebex-meeting&_bt=341925909040&_bm=b&_bn=g&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1277538&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoebsBRCHARIsAC3JP0I_-APvTlgltgOxGioKgSKl-7hPVhLXd6ff3chfTjbcQzVpMtoG9AQaAlyqEALw_wcB) or [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/start). The tools enable employees to participate in meetings from wherever they are in the world. Employees can also share their screens for presentation purposes. Cisco and Microsoft for example have even a free to use version.

Managing internal projects is also part of internal communication and it can be extremely time consuming to keep employees always up to date, to coordinate and to manage the project plan. In order to safe time, companies should start using more tools like [Trello](https://trello.com/) for example. Within Trello one can easily create Kanban-Boards or to-do lists. These so called “boards” can be shared with others by invitation, which enables not just a good overview about the upcoming tasks, but it is also accessible from everywhere with any smart device as long as you are connected to the internet. Tools like Trello lets one work more collaboratively as every team member can instantly change the status of tasks or just check for updates.

Internal communication is often overlooked. It does not require a lot of time to enable your employees access to tools like those just mentioned in this report. More and more millennials, which grew up with so much technology. They are used to fast changing environments. They are used to instant messaging. And they are open for new tools and technologies. But what they do not want is to have old fashioned ways to work as This will frustrate and unmotivated young talents. Digitalization, agility and transparency are buzz words of the modern way to work. Modern communication possibilities help to achieve them and will thereby reduce wasted time and your travel expenses.

Start now and improve the level of agility, the efficiency and the satisfaction of your employees!
