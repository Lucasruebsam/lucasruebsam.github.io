## Why is it important for companies to enable a good and fast internal communication through digitalization?

Digitalization is a huge and unstoppable megatrend in the modern world since ages (Gillior, 2018). While most of the companies focus on digitizing processes to improve the efficiency, a comparable low amount focuses to digitize and improve the communication within a company (Hays, 2018,p.2). This report provides an overview about what internal communication means, where it takes place, the advantages that come from digitizing it, why it is important to foster it and how companies communicate nowadays with different digital tools.

### What does it mean when we talk about internal communication and where does it take place?

When we talk about internal or intercompany communication, its meant communication within one company and the belonging subsidiaries and other company locations.

Business units, teams and skilled employees are nowadays in the modern world of multinational enterprises spread around the globe. While the digitalization in companies increases, the number of projects and interlinkages between the different company locations increases as well (Bloomberg, 2018). In order to operate successfully and beneficial, the level of intercompany or internal communication is highly important.

Communication can be executed by human beings but also automatically by machines or software via multiple channels. There is a difference between offline and online channels. Offline channels are those which do not have a digital connection for example post, or face to face meetings. On the other side, online channels can be related to the internet or in which technology is implicated and is for instance, online meetings or email communication.

### Why is a good internal communication important?

Having a good internal communication is important for any company. “People, communication, organization and administration are interrelated factors that need to be examined in detail” (Thayer, 2012, p.29 as cited in Neto, da Silva, & Ferreira 2018, p.218). Communication is important to build up relationships, to make momentous decisions and clarify problems or to help others (Neto, da Silva, & Ferreira 2018, p.218). According to the HR-Report of Hays, not enough communication is the biggest obstacle for leaders, while nowadays the focus is still on the competencies of the topic related know-how instead of communication skills (2018, p.2).

Communication is a big factor to succeed. Using slow communication channels within the fast-changing environment will lead to unmotivated and frustrated employees. According to the journal of Neto, da Silva and Ferreira communication promotes not just decisions, but also organizational values and it guides employees in the processes of structural change (2018, p.217). Companies are forced to frequently adapt, to decide quickly in order to stay tuned to the changing environment.
